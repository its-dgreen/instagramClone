# React Native Instagram Clone

> Instagram clone using Firebase & React Native

## Pre-planning Thoughts

I plan on creating this app as a way to test my knowledge with React Native and
mobile development. I plan on using Firebase for auth and data storage,
react-navigation/native for navigation. I don't plan on using TypeScript, I want
to use that for a different project later.

Vaguely following along with [freeCodeCamp's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hPgQWbWmEk)
